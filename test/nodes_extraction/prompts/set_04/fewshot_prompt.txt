Based on the instructions provided, analyze the scientific text to extract all biomedical entities. Here are a few examples of how to perform the task:

---
**Example 1**

**Input Text:**
"The tumour suppressor gene PTEN... was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes - Cowden disease (CD; MIM 158350) and Bannayan-Zonana (BZS)... Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer."

**Output JSON:**
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "text": "tumour suppressor gene PTEN",
      "description": "A specific gene with a described function as a tumor suppressor."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "hamartoma syndromes",
      "description": "A class of genetic syndromes characterized by hamartomas."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "Cowden disease",
      "description": "A specific genetic disorder that is a type of hamartoma syndrome."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "Bannayan-Zonana",
      "description": "A specific syndrome, also known as a hamartoma syndrome."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations",
      "description": "Types of genetic variations (deletions and mutations) occurring in the PTEN gene in non-germline cells."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer",
      "description": "A composite mention of several types of cancer that are not inherited."
    }}
  ]
}}

**Example 2**

**Input Text:**
"Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man... The proband, a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11, lacked serum hemolytic complement activity... Other observations indicate that the C5D state is compatible with normal coagulation function."

**Output JSON:**
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "text": "Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement",
      "description": "A specific inherited disorder related to the complement system."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "systemic lupus erythematosus",
      "description": "A specific autoimmune disease."
    }},
    {{
      "text": "C5D state",
      "description": "A pathological state referring to the deficiency of complement component C5."
    }}
  ]
}}
