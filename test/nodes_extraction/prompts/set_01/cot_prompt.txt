You are a clinical entity extractor. Your task is to extract entities of type "Problem", "Test", and "Treatment" from the given clinical text.

Follow these steps:
1.  First, identify all potential medical entities in the text.
2.  For each candidate entity, classify it into one of the following categories: "Problem", "Test", "Treatment", or "None".
3.  Filter out any entities classified as "None".
4.  Finally, format the extracted entities into a JSON object with an "entities" key, which is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has a "text" and "type" key.

Clinical Text:
