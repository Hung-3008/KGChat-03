Extract biomedical entities from scientific text following the patterns in these examples.

**Entity Types:**
- SpecificDisease: Specific diseases, syndromes, medical conditions
- DiseaseClass: Broad disease categories, general medical terminology
- Modifier: Genes, proteins, genetic markers, chromosomal regions

**Example 1:**

Text: "Abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man, mouse, rat and dog. The major cause of hepatic copper accumulation in man is a dysfunctional ATP7B gene, causing Wilson disease (WD)."

Output:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "hepatic copper accumulation", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "inherited disorder", "type": "DiseaseClass"}},
    {{"text": "ATP7B", "type": "Modifier"}},
    {{"text": "Wilson disease", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "WD", "type": "SpecificDisease"}}
  ]
}}

**Example 2:**

Text: "The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations."

Output:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "colorectal cancer", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "familial adenomatous polyposis", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "FAP", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "adenomatous polyposis coli", "type": "Modifier"}},
    {{"text": "APC", "type": "Modifier"}}
  ]
}}

**Example 3:**

Text: "By investigating the common autosomal recessive copper toxicosis (CT) in Bedlington terriers, we have identified a new locus involved in progressive liver disease."

Output:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "copper toxicosis", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "CT", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "liver disease", "type": "DiseaseClass"}}
  ]
}}

---
**Example 4:**

Text: "Mutations in the ATP7B genes have also been demonstrated in mouse and rat. The ATP7B gene has been excluded in the much rarer human copper overload disease non-Indian childhood cirrhosis, indicating genetic heterogeneity."

Output:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "ATP7B", "type": "Modifier"}},
    {{"text": "copper overload", "type": "SpecificDisease"}},
    {{"text": "non-Indian childhood cirrhosis", "type": "SpecificDisease"}}
  ]
}}

---
**Example 5:**

Text: "Direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non-FAP colorectal cancer."

Output:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "APC", "type": "Modifier"}},
    {{"text": "FAP", "type": "Modifier"}},
    {{"text": "colorectal cancer", "type": "Modifier"}}
  ]
}}

**Key Patterns to Learn:**

1. **Disease + Abbreviation**: Extract both forms
   - "Wilson disease (WD)" → extract "Wilson disease" AND "WD"
   - "familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)" → extract both
   
2. **Gene Names = Modifier**: Always classify genes/proteins as Modifier
   - "ATP7B gene", "APC gene", "CTR1", "CTR2" → all Modifier
   
3. **Context Matters**: Same term, different types
   - "colorectal cancer" as diagnosis → SpecificDisease
   - "colorectal cancer" in "non-FAP colorectal cancer" → Modifier
   - "APC" gene → Modifier, but in clinical context varies
   
4. **Complete Phrases**: Extract full entity
   - "hepatic copper accumulation" (not just "accumulation")
   - "familial adenomatous polyposis" (not just "polyposis")
   
5. **No Duplicate Entities**: The final output should not contain duplicates. If an entity is mentioned multiple times with the same type, extract it only once.

**Output Format:**

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with NO additional text, markdown, or explanations. The output should be a JSON object with a single key 'entities', which is a list of objects. Each object should have two keys: 'text' and 'type'. Do not include 'start' and 'end' keys.
