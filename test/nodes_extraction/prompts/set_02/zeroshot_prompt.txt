**Entity Definitions:**

- SpecificDisease: A specific, well-defined disease, syndrome, or medical condition
  - Characteristics: Has specific diagnostic criteria, clinical features, or pathophysiology
  - Examples: Wilson disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, hepatic copper accumulation, hypertension, non-Indian childhood cirrhosis
  - Include: Genetic disorders, specific syndromes, organ-specific diseases, named conditions
  - Include abbreviations: WD (Wilson disease), FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis), CT (copper toxicosis)

- DiseaseClass: A broad category, family, or general classification of diseases
  - Characteristics: General medical terminology, not a specific diagnostic entity
  - Examples: inherited disorder, liver disease, colorectal cancer (when used as a general term)
  - Include: Disease classifications, pathological states, medical categories, syndrome families

- Modifier: Genes, proteins, chromosomal regions, or molecular entities associated with disease
  - Characteristics: Biological molecules, genetic markers, or molecular mechanisms
  - Examples: ATP7B gene, APC gene, CTR1, CTR2, C04107 marker, chromosome 10
  - Include: Gene names, protein names, genetic loci, chromosomal locations, biomarkers
  - Note: Gene names may appear with or without "gene" suffix

**Extraction Rules:**

1. Extract the EXACT text span as it appears (preserve capitalization, spacing)
2. Consider full context - the same term may have different types in different sentences
3. Extract both full forms AND abbreviations when present (e.g., "Wilson disease (WD)" â†’ extract both)
4. Include all modifying words (e.g., "familial adenomatous polyposis" not just "polyposis")
5. For compound terms, extract the complete entity (e.g., "hepatic copper accumulation" as one entity)
6. When a gene name appears, classify it as Modifier regardless of context
7. When uncertain, consider the syntactic role in the sentence
8. Do not extract duplicate entities. If an entity is mentioned multiple times with the same type, extract it only once.

**Output Format:**

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with NO additional text, markdown, or explanations. The output should be a JSON object with a single key 'entities', which is a list of objects. Each object should have two keys: 'text' and 'type'. Do not include 'start' and 'end' keys.
