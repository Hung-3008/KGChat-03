Your task is to identify and classify medical entities from scientific literature into two categories: Disease and Modifier.

First, think step-by-step about the entities in the text. Identify potential diseases, conditions, genes, and proteins.
Second, classify each identified entity into one of the two categories.
Third, format the output as a single JSON object.

**Entity Categories:**

1.  **Disease**: Any disease, syndrome, pathological condition, or sign/symptom.
    *   Examples: "cancer", "hypertension", "Wilson disease", "hepatic copper accumulation", "delirium".
    *   This includes specific diseases, classes of diseases, and related conditions.

2.  **Modifier**: Genes, proteins, or other molecules that are related to a disease.
    *   Examples: "ATP7B gene", "APC", "H2-receptor antagonist".

**Instructions:**

*   Extract the EXACT text span of the entity as it appears in the source document.
*   Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key "entities".
*   The "entities" key should contain a list of objects, where each object has "text" and "type".
*   Do not include `start` and `end` positions.

**Output Format:**
```json
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"text": "exact entity text", "type": "Disease"}},
    {{"text": "exact entity text", "type": "Modifier"}}
  ]
}}
```
