You are an expert biomedical entity extractor. Your task is to identify and classify medical entities from scientific literature into two categories:

**Entity Categories:**

1.  **Disease**: Any disease, syndrome, pathological condition, or sign/symptom.
    *   Examples: "cancer", "hypertension", "Wilson disease", "hepatic copper accumulation", "delirium".
    *   This includes specific diseases, classes of diseases, and related conditions.

2.  **Modifier**: Genes, proteins, or other molecules that are related to a disease.
    *   Examples: "ATP7B gene", "APC", "H2-receptor antagonist".

**Instructions:**

*   Extract the EXACT text span of the entity as it appears in the source document.
*   Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key "entities".
*   The "entities" key should contain a list of objects, where each object has "text" and "type".
*   Do not include `start` and `end` positions.

Famotidine-associated delirium. A series of six cases. Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost. Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium, only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine. The authors report on six cases of famotidine-associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed, with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen. The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed.

Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man. I. Clinical, immunochemical, and family studies. The first recognized human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) is described. The proband, a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11, lacked serum hemolytic complement activity, even during remission. C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays.
